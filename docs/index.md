Welcome to Scotty3D! This 3D graphics software implements interactive mesh
editing, realistic path tracing, and dynamic animation. Implementing the
functionality of the program constitutes the majority of the coursework for
15-462/662 Computer Graphics at Carnegie Mellon University

The [building Scotty3D](building.md) page describes how to build and run `Scotty3D` on various platforms.

The [User Guide](guide/guide.md) describes the intended functionality of the software to an end user.

The components of the Developer Manual are exhaustively listed on the sidebar to the right, and are organized under the three main components of the software:

- [MeshEdit](meshedit/overview.md)
- [PathTracer](pathtracer/overview.md)
- [Animation](animation/overview.md)

See the sidebar on the right for access to all material in this wiki. In particular,
please read through the [Project Philosophy](philosophy.md) before you begin work.
